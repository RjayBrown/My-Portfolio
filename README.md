## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

**Link to site:** https://rjbrown.dev

## Lessons Learned:

For this project my goal was to understand semantic HTML structure and experiment with as many CSS styles as possible. I'm more comfortable with managing specificity and maintaining code organization, so it's easier to make changes while maintaining the responsiveness of the design. Working with transitions and animations was fun, can't stop noticing cool animations on different websites (the animation for the YouTube like button is ðŸ”¥) I definitely plan to continue learning about more advanced CSS styles and features.
